# Dot Files
This is the repo for all my personal dot files. I did not write all of these but they are the ones
I prefer.

## How to Install _on MacOS_
- Clone this repo
- Copy the files into you ~ directory
- Enjoy!

## Info
This repo currently contains dot files for vim, bash, zsh, and eslint. I hope to be adding more files
soon including more linters and a better bashrc.
